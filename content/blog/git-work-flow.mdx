ðŸ’¡ How to fork a repo

[Fork a repo - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)

2. Clone the forked repository from your **own** GitHub (!!**not the** repo in TPP).

   ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/yourgithub/IMAS_Workload_Frontend.git

   ```

   Go inside the path where you cloned the repo. All commands will be run in this folder.

```bash
 cd IMAS_Workload_Frontend
```

3. Check your local repoâ€™s remote

```bash
      git remote -v
```

**origin** is your own GitHub repo

**upstream** is TPPâ€™s GitHub repo which your forked from

If you donâ€™t have the upstream repo, add it.

```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/TPP-PROJECTS/IMAS_Workload_Frontend.git
```

## Development

1. Make sure your develop branch is always updated to upstream(TPP)â€™s develop before your create feature branch

   1. go to develop

```bash
      git checkout develop
```

2.  pull the latest develop code from TPP to your local develop

```bash
      git pull --rebase upstream develop
```

2. Create new branch from develop to write code. **DO NOT** write code in main or develop branch.

```bash
      git checkout -b feature/a-new-feature-title-from-trello develop
```

3. Write your code and make commit. Please follow the `commit rules`.

4. This moment, your team members may have committed their code into TPPâ€™ develop branch so your have to update your branch.

   Make sure you still in your working feature branch `(feature/a-new-feature-title-from-trello)`

```bash
      git rebase upstream/develop
```

Push your code to your own GitHub repository

```bash
      git push origin
```

If itâ€™s your first time pushing this branch `(feature/a-new-feature-title-from-trello)` to your GitHub repository

```bash
      git push -u origin HEAD
```

   Now you can make a pull request from your feature branch to TPPâ€™s develop branch.
